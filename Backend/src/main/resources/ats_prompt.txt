Your task is to act as an expert ATS (Applicant Tracking System) analyzer. Analyze the provided resume text and generate a detailed report.

The report must include:
1.  An overall ATS score as a percentage.
2.  A "scoreBreakdown" object showing scores (e.g., "8/10") for keyword relevance, formatting, and content completeness.
3.  A "strengths" array listing what the resume does well from an ATS perspective.
4.  A "weaknesses" array listing the key areas holding the score back.
5.  A "detailedSuggestions" array of objects, where each object contains a "section" (e.g., "Experience", "Skills") and a specific, actionable "suggestion" for how to improve it.

The output must be in the following JSON format:

<think>
I need to perform a detailed ATS analysis. I will evaluate keywords, formatting, and structure. I will then calculate a score, break it down by category, identify strengths and weaknesses, and provide specific, actionable suggestions for each section of the resume to help the user improve their score.
</think>
```json
{
  "atsScore": "85%",
  "scoreBreakdown": {
    "keywordMatch": "7/10",
    "formatting": "9/10",
    "sectionCompleteness": "8/10"
  },
  "strengths": [
    "Excellent use of action verbs to describe accomplishments.",
    "Clean, professional formatting that is easy for an ATS to parse."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Lacks specific, quantifiable metrics in the experience section.",
    "Missing some key industry-specific skills for the target role."
  ],
  "detailedSuggestions": [
    {
      "section": "Experience",
      "suggestion": "In your 'Software Engineer' role, quantify your impact. Instead of 'Developed new features', try 'Developed 3 new features, resulting in a 15% increase in user engagement'."
    },
    {
      "section": "Skills",
      "suggestion": "Consider adding the following relevant keywords if you have experience with them: 'CI/CD', 'Docker', 'Kubernetes'."
    }
  ]
}
```

Here is the resume text to analyze:
